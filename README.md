# Dont-Stay-Up-Late

Don't Stay Up Late is a Unity game I made with friends as a project during our first semester at Keimyung University. Our End Semester task for the 3D Game Basic course was to create a 3D Game, with a minimap, and inventory, and an NPC.
We chose to make an horror game, where you try to exit a building, while escaping an hostile monster.

# How the game works

In order to escape, you need to find specific items on the map. These items can later be used to unlock other rooms (key), illuminate the map (flashlight), or see where the monster is (computer).
While trying to find items, you need to avoid the monster. By default, it randomly roams the map, but it will chase the player once sighted.

# Personnal contribution

I focused on the items and the inventory for this project.
I made the 3D models for the table, chair, flashlight, computer, and circuit breaker.
I created the inventory system. When looking at an item on the map, and by pressing 'E', the item will be added to the inventory.
Pressing 'Tab' displays the items owned by the player. Clicking an item equips it.
There is also an item swaying. By moving the character, or moving the mouse, the item will rotate a little. There is also head bobbing when the character moves.
These 2 elements where added to make movement more satisfying.
Finally, i was in charge to add sounds for picking up items, equipping them, opening doors, and turning on/off lights.
